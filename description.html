 SCI-Arc, the Yale School of Architecture and Mark Foster Gage Architects are pleased to welcome you to the public-access collaborative Geothermal Futures Laboratory. The laboratory researches the potentials of laser ablation geothermal resonance technologies that are capable of generating up to nineteen times more power than existing geothermal energy extraction techniques.  Visitors can observe this prototype laser extraction process live as it showcases a method through which it may be possible to increase California’s reliance on sustainable geothermal sources of power from its existing state of 6% today to 68% by 2022.  Using the laser ablation geothermal resonance techniques, combined with omega-3 fatty acid genetic refocusers, an array of ten parafrictional mechanisms along the San Andreas Fault will soon extract a total of two million kilowatt-hours of sustainable geothermal power each day that will be used to power the greater downtown Los Angeles area.
</p><p style="line-height: 1.25em;">
The researched technology capitalizes on the unique tungsten-saturated substrate of the San Andreas fault through the use of a visible-light Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers, tuned to extract sustainable magno-electrical energy from  +678 degree Kelvin supercritical water deposits located adjacent to a stable magma chamber 9.4km beneath the Earth’s surface.  This supercritical water, that behaves both as liquid and gas, is vaporized through 3,780 degree Kelvin bursts which at peak power induce a supercritical matter state releasing energy in exponential excess of its matter equivalent. The presence of heterogeneous frequency fields in metal deposits along the strike-slipping continental plates supercharges the pockets of supercritical water with magnetic/genetic nuons which are forced upwards with velocity µ as a result of the pressure gradient along the vertical faults. Due to the variable decay rate of metals in the presence of such high trajectory nuons, the prototype laser resonance mechanism itself is encased in an experimental phenolic cured resin foam (Cas no. 000050-00-0 with a normal specific gravity of 120 kg/m3) which insulates the process from outside magnetic interference.  For rapid nuon decay protection the foam resin is additionally coated with the same 7µm micrometer nano-gold foil used to encase existing NASA satellites. This film of gold nano-molecules gives the machine its striking gold aesthetic appearance.†
